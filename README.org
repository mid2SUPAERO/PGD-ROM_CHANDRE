* Structural Wing Model Reduction in Fluid-Structure Interactions.

Author: Oriol CHANDRE-VILA.

This GitHub focuses the use of Reduced Order Models to lighten the computational requirements in fluid-structure problem simulations. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Proper Generalized Decomposition methodologies are studied and applied in a Steady Advection-Diffusion problem for 2D and non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Thanks to the above-mentioned approaches, important reductions in computing time have been achieved.
